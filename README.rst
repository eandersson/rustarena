Rust Arena
==========
A mod aimed at cramming the entire Rust experience into a ~3 hour competitive format.

Gameplay Breakdown
==================

Warmup Phase
------------
You have 15 minutes to pick teams.

Preparation Phase
-----------------
A wall is raised that divides the map into 4 squares with each team getting its own monument (oil rig). During this time, each team has an hour to collect, build and fight NPCs (oil right by default) to prepare for the raiding phase. It's all about finding the perfect balance to make sure that you can be effective at both defending and attacking during the raiding phase.

Building
~~~~~~~~~
Before the preparation phase ends, each team needs to build a base and place a Tool Cupboard. If they lose the Tool Cupboard during the Raiding phase, they are out.

Collecting
~~~~~~~~~~~
To be able to build a base, each team will need to collect and smelt resources (e.g. wood, stone, metal).

Do monuments
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each team has access to a monument (oil rig) that if defeated, will drop pre-determined loot. This will help the team unlock high tier weapons (e.g. Assault Rifles).

Raiding Phase
-------------
During the raid phase, the goal is to destroy the enemy teams; Tool Cupboard. In addition, each team also starts with a limited number of re-spawn tickets and if a team runs out of spawn tickets, they automatically lose.

Gameplay Optimizations
======================
- All Blueprints are automatically unlocked.
- Gathering resources starts at 6x and increases by 1x every 10 minutes during the raiding phase.
- Day/Night cycle has been disabled.
- Stack sizes increased.
- Build times lowered.
